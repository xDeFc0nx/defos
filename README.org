* About defos

defos is the name that I have chosen for my post-installation script that will deploy my Xmonad config, my Emacs config, as well as associated programs that are needed to create a proper "desktop" experience.  defos should work on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution.  The programs that will be installed include Xmonad, Xmobar, Doom Emacs, Fish and other programs needed to recreate DT's XMonad desktop.  defos is only for x86_64 architecture and will not work on ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

* Installing defos
** Installation instructions
To install defos, you need to clone this repository and run the ~defos~ script.
#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/xDeFc0nx/defos
cd defos/
./defos
#+end_example

** Potential bugs
*** Slow download times.
This script can take a long time to complete since it will install more than 300 packages.  Also, make sure that the Linux distro that you are installing this on uses ParallelDownloads in /etc/pacman.conf for faster download times!  For an example, to enable ParallelDownloads so it downloads up to five packages at a time:

#+begin_example
ParallelDownloads = 5
#+end_example
*** Package conflicts that cause the script to fail
+ shell-color-scripts (from defos-core-repo) conflicts with shell-color-scripts from the AUR.
+ defos-opendoas (from defos-core-repo) conflicts with opendoas from the Arch repos.

The solution is, before running the script, edit the pkglist.txt file and remove the packages above.

*** Doom Emacs doesn't launch.
After the installation is completed, Doom Emacs may not launch correctly the very first time.  Killing the Emacs server (if running) and restarting it fixes this.
#+begin_example
killall emacs
/usr/bin/emacs --daemon &
#+end_example

* Updating defos
defos is updated in the standard way as all Arch-based Linux distros:
#+begin_example
sudo pacman -Syu
#+end_example

Many defos packages are configuration files.  Those packages install their config files to /etc/defos since we don't want to overwrite your config files accidentally.  If you want to use the updated configs, then you need to manually copy the configs from /etc/defos into $HOME.

=NOTE:= There is no need to run the defos script more than once.  If you have successfully installed defos, then you already have access to the [[https://github.com/xDeFc0nx/defos-core-repo][defos core repository]] and all of the defos packages.  If a newer version of defos installs packages that your version did not, then just install those packages yourself using pacman.

* Contributing to defos
Community contributions to the defos script is welcomed.  There are a few things to consider before making a merge request.
** Edit README.org
I understand that non-Emacs users may be confused with the way literate programming works, but the actual defos script is ~README.org~ which gets converted to ~defos~.  So the file you should edit is ~README.org~ and not ~defos~.  Through the magic of Org Mode in Emacs, ~README.org~ gets converted to ~defos~.  If you edit ~defos~ (and not ~README.org~) and make a merge request, then I have to manually edit ~README.org~ to make it conform to your proposed changes.  For a big merge, this is a lot work and could lead to mistakes being made in copying/pasting your changes.

To help non-Emacs users, there is a script in this repo (~convert.sh~) that will convert ~README.org~ into ~defos~.  This will allow you to edit ~README.org~ in whatver editor that you prefer, and then convert it to see if exports to ~defos~ correctly.
** Test your changes before pushing
It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need to test the script.  Please don't do a merge request without attempting to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven't previously ran the script on).

* Check that user is NOT root!
Don't run this script as root!  This is done for safety reasons.  This script makes a lot of changes to the $HOME of the $USER of this script.  For obvious reasons, we want $USER to not be 'root' and $HOME not to be '/root'.  Instead, run this script as a normal user.  You will be asked to enter a sudo password at several points during the installation.

    echo "The \$HOME directory of the root user is, of course, '/root'."
    echo "We don't want to mess around in there. So run this script as a"

#+end_src

* Install the packages from repositories
All packages listed are either in the standard Arch repos or in the defos repos. All of these will be installed using pacman.  The only program that will not be installed through pacman is Doom Emacs, which will be installed later in the script.

=NOTE:= The '--ask 4' option is an undocumented option for pacman that can be found in pacman's source code (in pacman's alpm.h).  Adding this flags means that all questions about removing packages that are conflicts will automatically be answered YES.

#+begin_src bash
# Let's install each package listed in the pkglist.txt file.
sudo pacman --needed --ask 4 -Sy - < pkglist.txt
#+end_src

* Copy configs over from /etc/defos into $HOME
While it would be easier to make packages that could install defos configs directly to the appropriate places in the $HOME folder, pacman does not allow for this.  Pacman is not allowed to touch $HOME ever!  The better way to do this is to install the configs in /etc/skel which is the standard directory to place such config files, but on many distros (for ex. Manjaro and Arco) /etc/skel is already used to store the distro's own config files.  So to avoid conflicts, all defos configs are placed in /etc/defos and then copied over to $HOME.  A backup of config is created.  BEWARE!

=NOTE:= The /etc/defos directory contains files and directories that are automatically copied over to a new user's home directory when such user is created by the 'useradd' or the 'adduser' program, depending on your Linux distro.
